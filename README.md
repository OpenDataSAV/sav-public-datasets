### Crime and Safety
##### Weekly and annual reports by crime type, neighborhood and precincts available as PDFs [here](http://scmpd.org/annual-crime-report/)

+ Using [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/), I have scraped the 2015 Annual Part 1 Crime data as a CSV then added to a Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ik8Jm6rRQCScTMMIs9m3heag6GRUsQ0hD9oE086IPS0/edit?usp=sharing). 

+ In addition, I was able to find the corresponding geospatial polygon KML  files for each SCMPD-defined neighborhood, along with precinct-level polygons,  from SAGISServices  [here](http://sagisservices.thempc.org/saint/rest/services/OpenData/SCMPD/MapServer)

+ Using CARTO.com currently to wrangle messy KML data and pair up neighborhood polygons with data from all 120 or so neighborhoods.

+ This method is replicable for all crime data from SCMPD if they cannot provide data as CSV or JSON.
